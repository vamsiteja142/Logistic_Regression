Logistic Regression

The Logistic Regression or Logistic Model also called the Logit Model is a classification algorithm that predicts a categorical feature based on a set of independent variables. Logistic Regression is one of the simplest classification algorithms that can be used to predict values for a categorical dependent variable.

An Introduction to Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression Analysis
Logistic Regression
In this practise session, we will learn to code Logistic Regression.We will perform the following steps to build a simple classifier using the popular Iris dataset. You can find the dataset here.

Step 1. Data Preprocessing 

Importing the libraries.
Importing dataset (Dataset Link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).
Dealing with the categorical variable.
Classifying dependent and independent variables.
Splitting the data into a training set and test set.
Feature scaling.
Step 2. Logistic Regression 

Create a Logistic classifier.
Feed the training data to the classifier.
Predicting the species for the test set.
Using the confusion matrix to find accuracy.
